# Automatic Differentiation System (242-THE4)
- Implemented an object-oriented solution for automatic differentiation, utilizing polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and
inheritance principles.
- Developed a robust system that efficiently computes derivatives of polynomials by constructing expression trees and employing
operator overloading in C++

# Internet Browsers’ Tab and Windows Mechanisms (213-THE1)
- Developed a tabbed browser application with multiple windows and tabs, utilizing circular doubly linked lists as the underlying
data structure for efficient tab and window management.

# Self-balancing BST based map (213-THE2)
- Implemented a self-balancing binary search tree data structure called Scapegoat Tree, along with a TreeMap (key-value map) using
this structure, achieving efficient lookup and insertion times while maintaining the ordered nature of entries in the map.

# 3D object painter (213-THE3)
- Developed a 3D object painter application, utilizing Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm within a custom Binary Heap data structure
and a specialized graph structure for efficient vertex coloring in 3D objects.
