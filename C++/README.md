# Automatic Differentiation System
- Implemented an object-oriented solution for automatic differentiation, utilizing polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and
inheritance principles.
- Developed a robust system that efficiently computes derivatives of polynomials by constructing expression trees and employing
operator overloading in C++
